# Intermediate C++ Programming Quizzes
This repository contains compiled quizzes on intermediate programming in C++. Each quiz focuses on specific programming problems, and their solutions are provided as compiled binary files.

## Files

1. `quiz1-finals-creditcard-vector.cpp`
   - Description: C++ source code for the quiz on Credit Card data using vectors.

2. `quiz1-finals-modified-employee.cpp`
   - Description: C++ source code for the quiz on modifying Employee records.

3. `quiz1-midterm-summation.cpp`
   - Description: C++ source code for the quiz on summation of data during the midterm.

4. `quiz2-finals-right-triangle`
   - Description: Compiled binary for the quiz on Right Triangles.

5. `quiz2-midterm-ordered-recursive.cpp`
   - Description: C++ source code for the quiz on ordered recursive functions during the midterm.

6. `quiz2-midterm-ordered-recursive.o`
   - Description: Compiled binary for the quiz on ordered recursive functions during the midterm.

## How to Use

Since the quizzes are provided as compiled binaries, you can directly execute the corresponding files to test and review the quiz solutions.

1. Download the repository to your local machine.
2. Choose the quiz you want to review and locate the corresponding file.
3. Execute the compiled binary to see the output and behavior of the quiz solution.

## How to Contribute

As the quizzes are provided as compiled binaries, contributions in the form of modifications to the quiz solutions are not possible in this repository. However, if you have additional quizzes or C++ exercises to share, you can create a new repository and follow the format provided in this README to document and share your work.

## Credits

The quizzes included in this repository were compiled as part of an intermediate C++ programming course. Credits to the course instructor and the contributors of the quiz problems.

Happy coding and learning!
